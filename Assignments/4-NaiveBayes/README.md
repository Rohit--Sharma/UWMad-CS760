# Programming Assignment - 4
## Naive Bayes and Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN)

### Usage:
The program can be started from the command line by passing in 3 arguments as follows:
```
$ bayes <train-set-file> <test-set-file> <n|t>      # n: Naive Bayes, t: TAN
```
The training set and the testing set data should be passed in [ARFF file format](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/arff_stable/). The data sets are to be placed in the dataset directory, from where the program directly picks them up.
