# Programming Assignment - 3
## Neural Network - Backpropagation

### Usage:
The program can be started from the command line by passing in 4 arguments as follows:
```
$ neuralnet trainfile num_folds learning_rate num_epochs 
```
The training set and the testing set data should be passed in [ARFF file format](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/arff_stable/). The data sets are to be placed in the dataset directory, from where the program directly picks them up.
